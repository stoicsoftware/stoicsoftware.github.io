## NetSuite Help

NetSuite Help is the most definitive reference for the `N/search` module and all of its capabilities. I recommend 
studying the following articles and any related sub-articles:

## The Records Browser

The Records Browser is an absolutely crucial tool for creating effective searches. There is a new version of the 
Records Browser for every version of NetSuite. The 2023.1 version can be found
[here](https://system.netsuite.com/help/helpcenter/en_US/srbrowser/Browser2023_1/script/record/account.html).
If you are unfamiliar with the Records Browser, see the
[overview in NetSuite Help](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_1527577879.html).

## Use the Search UI

A great way to both learn about and verify your SuiteScript searches is to actually build the search in the UI first,
then translate it into SuiteScript.

By doing this, you can quickly verify that the Filters and Columns you're specifying actually give you the correct 
results before you even start writing code.

## NetSuite Search Export Chrome Plugin

There is a very helpful Chrome Plugin built by my former colleague David Smith. The Plugin is called "NetSuite 
Search Export", and it will automatically generate SuiteScript for any Saved Search in your account. You can find it 
[here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netsuite-search-export/gglbgdfbkaelbjpjkiepdmfaihdokglp).

To use this plugin:

1. Create a Saved Search in the UI
1. Save the search
1. Click the "Export to Script" link near the top right of the page

## NetSuite Professionals Slack Community

If you are not already a member of the
[NetSuite Professionals community](https://netsuiteprofessionals.com/slack/), I highly recommend you join us. Every 
day, thousands of NetSuite Professionals from around the world collaborate here to learn, troubleshoot, and grow our 
NetSuite skills - and it's completely free.

## Mozilla Developer Network

SuiteScript is simply a library on top of JavaScript, and the best JavaScript reference manual is the Mozilla 
Developer Network: https://developer.mozilla.org/

While not related specifically to NetSuite, this site is an excellent source of JavaScript reference material, 
examples, and tutorials.
