My name is [Eric T Grubaugh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erictgrubaugh/). I am a career NetSuite developer and 
coach; I've been writing SuiteScript exclusively since August 2012.

Currently, I host the [SuiteScript Stories podcast](https://hub.salto.io/collections/webinars) alongside my
friend (and SuiteQL guru) [Tim Dietrich](https://timdietrich.me/). You can also regularly find me in the
[NetSuite Professionals Slack Community](https://netsuiteprofessionals.com/slack/),
an online community where thousands of NetSuite Professionals collaborate and learn from each other every day.

Once upon a time, I wrote the [Sustainable SuiteScript](https://stoic.software/) blog series and ran the
[Stoic Software YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@StoicSoftware) to help developers and non-developers alike learn 
SuiteScript.
